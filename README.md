* The Wizard can now curse living creatures and enchant items
  * At third level, a wizard can curse a living creature or enchant an item.
  The wizard does this by
    1. Choosing a spell that they know
    2. Choosing a target
    3. Choosing a condition
  
  **The target:** The target needs to be within 5 feet of the caster for the duration of the casting. The wizard is able to extend the range by successfully casting the Scrying spell on the target
      at the beginning of the curse/enchantment.
  **The condition:** As the wizard cast the curse/enchantment, the wizard decides upon a condition when the spell is cast. If the wizard is a PC, then the DM needs to approve of this condition. 

  The casting time is 8 hours plus the casting time of the spell. When the spell is cast
    * It originates from the cursed person/enchanted object
    * It can affect the target or anything within line of sight of the target
    * Casting speed is maintained
    * Duration is maintained
    * Concentration requirement is ignored
    * Spell save DC is that of the wizard who cast the curse/enchantment.
    * Components are consumed upon casting the spell

  The spell will be cast on the target, when the condition is fullfilled.

# Motivation
## Mission statement
Playing the game should be fun, it is not fun when the player has to choose between having fun and playing optimally. Pure upgrades
do just that by removing choice. In a perfect world, all choices are sidegrades and bring something to the experience.

## Guiding principles
### Spellcasters vs martials
Spellcasters should not be the primary damage per round(DPR) dealers. They can do stuff that martials can, having them outshine martials
begs the question "why play anything but a spellcaster?". 

### Spell vs spell
At each level of a spellslot, no choice should be a must pick.

### Tension and release
Excitement is build by tension and release. Tension is build inside of each player as they watch a character do something,
release is felt when all players find out the outcome. No feat, ability or spell should take a way from this.

## Explanations
### Rogue is banned
The existance of the class effectively makes it impossible for the rest of the party to sneak, the stealth DC will either become too easy for the rogue or too difficult for the rest of the party. 

### Arcane Archer
The magical arrow removes all incentives for the arcane archer to use any special arrows against targets with resistances.
It also allows makes all resistances meaningless.

### Counter spell
Counter spell works as the ultimate solution to all spells. It renders saving throws, concentration breaking and all other
solutions pointless. In doing so it goes against tension and release.

### Dispel
See counter spell.

### Wall of force
In regards to CC, wall of force renders all other walls pointless. In doing so it breaks Spell vs spell. 
(A/N: I have never even seen anyone ever cast any other wall but wall of force)

### Forcecage
See wall of force.

### Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
See wall of force.

### Goodberry
This spell singlehandedly removes the need for looking for food, making survival in the wild trivial. In doing so it breaks 
Tension and Release.

### Create food and water
See goodberry.

### Prestidigitation
This spell singlehadedly removes the need for a bath. In doing so it breaks Tension and Release.


### Shield
Shield allows mages to temporary get an AC higher than that of a fighter. The mages ability to regain said spellslots at short rests
along with the sheer number of spellslots that a mage has after level 5 makes the cost negliegable. This spell breaks the
spellcaster vs martial principle.


### Lucky feat
This feat renders consequences meaningless. Failed a death saving throw - use lucky! Broke stealth - use lucky! In doing so it 
breaks the Tension and Release principle.

### Silvery barb
See Lucky feat.

### Fortune's favor
See lucky feat.

### Nystul's magic aura
It is too weak but a careless reading gives the impression of it protecting the user against divination spells, it does not.
It was removed to make way to a buffed Mordekainen's Private Sanctum.

## Walls
I want the walls to be viable tools for crowdcontroll. This becomes a problem if they have to compete for high level spellslots
with other spells that solve the problem by way of damage or just outright banishment. Moreover I want them to viable tools for CC at
level 5.


    * silvery barb is banned
    * fortune's favor is banned
    * nystul's magic aura is banned
